## Build Collaborative Apps, Get Cloud Credits & Hardware!

_A Hack Club YSWS where you build multiplayer/collaborative applications and earn cloud credits or a raspberry pi 4_

Turn your coding skills into collaborative experiences! Build apps that bring people together from multiplayer games to real-time collaborative tools and get rewarded for the time you spend.

### How the Process Works

1. **Get an Idea** - Think of an app that needs multiple users to function (collaborative games, shared tools, real-time chat, etc.)
2. **Set Up Hackatime** - Install the [Hackatime plugin](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup) for your code editor to track your coding time
3. **Code for 5+ Hours** - Spend at least 5 hours building (tracked via Hackatime) for $25 in cloud credits
4. **Deploy & Submit** - Push your code to GitHub, deploy your app, and submit it for review
5. **Get Rewarded** - Receive your rewards!

### Rewards

- **5 Hours** = **$25** in cloud credits
- **10 Hours** = **$50** in cloud credits OR **Raspberry Pi 4 (2GB)**

### Requirements

- ✅ **Multi-user Design** - Your app must require multiple users to function meaningfully  
- ✅ **Real-time Technology** - Use WebSockets, Socket.io, WebRTC, or similar
- ✅ **Minimum Time** - At least 5 hours of coding time
- ✅ **Hackatime Tracking** - Mandatory for time verification
- ✅ **Open Source** - Code must be on GitHub and app must be deployed

### Example Project Ideas

- Collaborative pixel art canvas
- Multiplayer tic-tac-toe or chess
- Shared whiteboard for brainstorming  
- Real-time chat application
- Collaborative story-writing app
- Synchronized pomodoro timer for study groups
- Live voting or polling system
- Multiplayer drawing game

2. Browse the [Project Gallery](https://hackmate.hackclub.dev/gallery) for inspiration
3. Join the `#hackmate` channel on Hack Club Slack for help and discussion
4. Set up [Hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/my/wakatime_setup) before you start coding

### Submission

When you're ready to submit:
1. Ensure your Hackatime shows at least 5 hours of coding time
2. Deploy your app and make sure it's publicly accessible
3. Push your code to a public GitHub repository
4. Submit your project through our [submission form](https://forms.hackclub.com/t/jAAFcfkEJ1us)

_Note: Your Slack email must be linked to your Hackatime account for time tracking verification._
